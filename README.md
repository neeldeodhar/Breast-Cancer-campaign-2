# Breast-Cancer-campaign-2
I have 2 versions of Jupyter notebook. For this project because tensorflow wasn't working in 1st version of Jupyter and Matplotlib wasn't working in 2nd version; I decided to split project into 2 parts: 2A and 2B: 
IN 2A I've been able to get the MLP classifier/regressor working and in 2B only the regressor is working.
